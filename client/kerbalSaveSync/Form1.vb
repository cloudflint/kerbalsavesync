    'ISSUES
    'Oh god where to begin
    'needs WAY more robust error handling
    'the way it reads/stores ships out the persitant file will fall down at the drop of a hat
    'This whole thing is in extreme alpha right now, if you trust this program with any data that you care about you are insane
    'The way it tracks what files are who's is kinda sucky
    'this whole thing is in general full of holes
    'alot of the console output needs to be formatted better
    'all the sql server connection info is curently hard coded in
    'need to add a mechanism to have vessels deleted off the server when they no longer exist in the owners save
    'Various outher issues that need documented!

    'BUGS
    'Trying to sync a save with no vessels in it causes crash
    'Various unhandled errors which could cause program to fail horribly, see warnings about possible null reference exceptions being thrown in the vb.net error list
    'various outher bugs that need documented!

    'BUILD NOTES
    'need to install mysql driver

    'CHANGELOG
